# Crypts and Caverns - 9000 on-chain generative dungeons.

# l1bridge.cairo - contract that synchronized state across L1/L2.

## How it works:
# Users hold and stake dungeons on ETH mainnet. 
# When a dungeon is staked or unstaked, an event is sent from the L1 contract to this contract.
# This contract then 'creates' or 'deletes' a dungeon at the given tokenId for the given user.

#### Interaces ####
# interface for dungeon contract
@contract_interface
namespace IDungeonContract:
    func set_dungeon(token_id : felt, address : felt, environment : felt, size : felt, name : felt):
    end
end

#### Configuration ####
# l1_address - The address of our L1 contract that will be sending stake/unstake messages
@storage_var
func l1_address() -> (address : felt):
end

# starknet_address - The address of our dungeons contract on starknet
@storage_var
func starknet_address() -> (address : felt):
end

#### Data Structure ####
# message
#   from_address [address] - The address of the L1 contract (to ensure the message is authentic)
#   token_id [1-9000] - The ID of the dungeon in question
#   staked [0-1] - if '1' the user has staked a dungeon and if '0' the user has unstaked a dungeon
#   user_address - The user's starknet address (required for stake but not unstake)
